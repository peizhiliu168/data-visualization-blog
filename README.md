# Peizhi's Data Visualization Blog
Welcome to my blog on data visualization! This will be an exposition of the various interesting visualizations, analyses, and artifacts - the good and the bad - I create and discover throughout my journey in [POLY_SCI 390](https://github.com/sarah-moore/lousy-graphs). 

Hope you enjoy the view and stay tuned for more :)

## About me
I am a senior at Northwestern University. My area of study is Computer Science and my area of interest lies in high performance computing (HPC) and networked systems. Generally, what motivates me to study this subject is its diverse applications and the coupling of theory and practice. To me, it is both fun to think about and *potentially* useful.

When I'm not staring at the screen (which is quite rare, unfortunately), I enjoy taking long walks around campus and playing badminton.
