# Visualization Blog 3: Final project proposal

In general, what are the factors that contribute to microplastic pollution in the ocean? The question itself is fairly broad so there are many ways to answer this question. One approach is to look at this question from an aggregated approach. This includes examining factors such as plastic production, plastic waste emission in tonnes/year into the ocean by country, or examining the probability of emitting plastic waste. By mapping these results with the distribution of microplastic particles in oceans we might be able to find correlations between microplastic concentrations and these aggregated factors. These visualizations can indicate to us target locations to reduce ocean microplastic consumption. 

To dive deep and explore different factors from a more specific perspective, I specifically want to look at the contribution of synthetic textiles to ocean microplastics. The overall amount of pollution from textiles can be calculated from textile sales or laundry washes per year. I want to first determine the contributions that textiles have on overall microplastic pollution, to showcase the influence textiles have on microplastic pollution. This can be done by comparing waste production from textiles to other sources of microplastics such as plastic pellets, tires, road markings, marine coatings, and personal care products. As with the aggregated factors, I also want to correlate ocean microplastic concentrations with synthetic textile consumption and exports from different countries. This is to pinpoint specific synthetic textile industries or customers that can be improved to reduce microplastic pollution in oceans.

An excellent visualization of global plastic production that I would like to reproduce is figure 4 in IUCN microplastics [report](https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2017-002-En.pdf). I thought this visualization was very clear in depicting the impact of synthetic fibers on microplastic pollution. I also really like the combination of text and pictures in the visualization from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/09/Pathway-of-plastic-to-ocean-800x491.png) which describes how plastics enter the world's oceans.
